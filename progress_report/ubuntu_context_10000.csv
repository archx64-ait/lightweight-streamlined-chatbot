10621,355.tsv,2008-12-25T14:04:00.000Z,Canaen,,My Wireless is disabled. How would I enable it?
10622,355.tsv,2008-12-25T14:04:00.000Z,hyperb0lix,Canaen,Can you right-click the NetworkManager applet and reenable wireless?
10623,355.tsv,2008-12-25T14:05:00.000Z,hyperb0lix,Canaen,:O I hope your wireless module(s) is/are loaded
10624,355.tsv,2008-12-25T14:06:00.000Z,hyperb0lix,Canaen,Make sure the wifi interface is up with ifconfig?
10625,355.tsv,2008-12-25T14:06:00.000Z,hyperb0lix,Canaen,Just run ifconfig from the command line and list the interfaces you find
10626,355.tsv,2008-12-25T14:06:00.000Z,hyperb0lix,Canaen,Should be the rightmost column
10627,355.tsv,2008-12-25T14:08:00.000Z,hyperb0lix,Canaen,lo is for loopback; one of the Ethernet ones might actually be your wireless
10628,355.tsv,2008-12-25T14:08:00.000Z,hyperb0lix,Canaen,eth1?
10629,355.tsv,2008-12-25T14:09:00.000Z,hyperb0lix,Canaen,Can you just run iwconfig now?
10630,355.tsv,2008-12-25T14:09:00.000Z,hyperb0lix,Canaen,"Err, is wireless *gone*? Or is it simply not working?"
10631,355.tsv,2008-12-25T14:10:00.000Z,hyperb0lix,Canaen,"Yep, your wireless is there"
10632,355.tsv,2008-12-25T14:11:00.000Z,hyperb0lix,Canaen,Yet NetworkManager is graying out your wireless?
10633,355.tsv,2008-12-25T14:11:00.000Z,hyperb0lix,Canaen,You could try a reboot first... or you could manually associate/authenticate with an access point
10634,355.tsv,2008-12-25T14:11:00.000Z,hyperb0lix,Canaen,"We've already established that your wireless interface is there and up, so there shouldn't be a problem associating"
10635,355.tsv,2008-12-25T14:12:00.000Z,hyperb0lix,Canaen,It'
10636,355.tsv,2008-12-25T14:12:00.000Z,hyperb0lix,Canaen,It's a little dirty... iwlist eth1 scan... iwconfig eth1 essid ESSID or iwconfig eth1 ap BSSID...
10637,355.tsv,2008-12-25T14:13:00.000Z,hyperb0lix,Canaen,Then you can use wpa_supplicant (eww) if it's WPA... or just go ahead and use dhclient/dhcpcd
10638,355.tsv,2008-12-25T14:13:00.000Z,hyperb0lix,Canaen,Or you can try a reboot first :)
10639,355.tsv,2008-12-25T14:13:00.000Z,hyperb0lix,Canaen,":O It's not in monitor mode, I hope"
10640,355.tsv,2008-12-25T14:14:00.000Z,hyperb0lix,Canaen,I would suggest a reboot unless you don't have time and/or don't want to mess with the commands (they can get dirty)
10641,355.tsv,2008-12-25T14:16:00.000Z,hyperb0lix,Canaen,Okay
10642,355.tsv,2008-12-25T14:20:00.000Z,hyperb0lix,Canaen,How'd it go?
10643,355.tsv,2008-12-25T14:20:00.000Z,hyperb0lix,Canaen,What wireless driver are you using?
10644,355.tsv,2008-12-25T14:22:00.000Z,hyperb0lix,Canaen,And your card is fully compatible with STA?
10645,355.tsv,2008-12-25T14:25:00.000Z,hyperb0lix,Canaen,"Hmm, I don't have much experience with Broadcom drivers: I try to avoid Broadcom like the plague"
10646,355.tsv,2008-12-25T14:26:00.000Z,hyperb0lix,Canaen,Could you pastebin the output of ifconfig and iwconfig?
10647,355.tsv,2008-12-25T14:26:00.000Z,hyperb0lix,Canaen,NO!
10648,355.tsv,2008-12-25T14:27:00.000Z,hyperb0lix,Canaen,:-X!!

10652,355.tsv,2008-12-25T14:29:00.000Z,hyperb0lix,Canaen,"Damn, so you can't scan for anything? sudo iwlist eth1 scan?"
10653,355.tsv,2008-12-25T14:29:00.000Z,hyperb0lix,Canaen,That's one of the most important things...
10654,355.tsv,2008-12-25T14:30:00.000Z,hyperb0lix,Canaen,"Gah, what was the result again?"
10655,355.tsv,2008-12-25T14:31:00.000Z,hyperb0lix,Canaen,iwlist shouldn't have the same output as iwconfig

10657,355.tsv,2008-12-25T14:35:00.000Z,hyperb0lix,Canaen,"Sorry, one sec"
10658,355.tsv,2008-12-25T14:36:00.000Z,hyperb0lix,Canaen,Could you do 'lsmod | grep b43'
10659,355.tsv,2008-12-25T14:36:00.000Z,hyperb0lix,Canaen,"Also, could you resend the pastebin link; I accidentally disconnected"
10660,355.tsv,2008-12-25T14:38:00.000Z,hyperb0lix,Canaen,"If it's >, just Ctrl+C it"
10661,355.tsv,2008-12-25T14:38:00.000Z,hyperb0lix,Canaen,The whole command is 'lsmod | grep b43'
10662,355.tsv,2008-12-25T14:38:00.000Z,hyperb0lix,Canaen,| is just a pipe
10663,355.tsv,2008-12-25T14:39:00.000Z,hyperb0lix,Canaen,"If there is no result, then b43 isn't loaded, which is good"
10664,355.tsv,2008-12-25T14:40:00.000Z,hyperb0lix,Canaen,"Blast, that makes no sense! The module is loaded, the interface is up, it is listed with iwconfig, yet you can't scan anything"
10665,355.tsv,2008-12-25T14:40:00.000Z,hyperb0lix,Canaen,I'm going to google around; see if others can help you in the meantime
10666,355.tsv,2008-12-25T14:41:00.000Z,hyperb0lix,Canaen,"Yeah, shouldn't have any difference when you're on the command line"
10667,355.tsv,2008-12-25T14:44:00.000Z,hyperb0lix,Canaen,What card is this again?
10668,355.tsv,2008-12-25T14:46:00.000Z,hyperb0lix,Canaen,You used the driver given to you by Ubuntu's restricted drivers utility?
10669,355.tsv,2008-12-25T14:48:00.000Z,hyperb0lix,Canaen,And it suddenly stops working?
10670,355.tsv,2008-12-25T14:48:00.000Z,hyperb0lix,Canaen,"If it's source, you can try recompiling and reinstalling"
10671,355.tsv,2008-12-25T14:49:00.000Z,hyperb0lix,Canaen,"Well, you could try reinstalling it through the same Ubuntu utility"
10672,355.tsv,2008-12-25T14:49:00.000Z,hyperb0lix,Canaen,Unchecking and rechecking it should work
10673,355.tsv,2008-12-25T14:52:00.000Z,hyperb0lix,Canaen,Anything?
10674,355.tsv,2008-12-25T14:53:00.000Z,hyperb0lix,Canaen,Bah

257055,3548.tsv,2009-03-27T10:06:00.000Z,QPrime,,from console lsusb  should give you usb version numbers
257056,3548.tsv,2009-03-27T10:07:00.000Z,TheDeepFriedBoot,QPrime,Just says command not found
257057,3548.tsv,2009-03-27T10:12:00.000Z,QPrime,TheDeepFriedBoot,btw... lsusb is part of the usbutils package if you want info on the package you can type 'apt-cache show usbutils'
257058,3548.tsv,2009-03-27T10:13:00.000Z,TheDeepFriedBoot,QPrime,"Thanks, know any good PCMCIA USB cards though? I want to put samba on the laptop and use it as a NAS for my windows machines"
257059,3548.tsv,2009-03-27T10:14:00.000Z,QPrime,TheDeepFriedBoot,firewire is a good choice if you have peripherals thats use it (choice might be a little more limited tho)
257060,3548.tsv,2009-03-27T10:15:00.000Z,TheDeepFriedBoot,QPrime,"I guess, the drive I wanted to use is USB only but I do have 2 firewire drives that would work."
257061,3548.tsv,2009-03-27T10:17:00.000Z,QPrime,TheDeepFriedBoot,the problem with PCMCIA/PC Card USB options is power... they almost always need an additional power source (sometimes even attached to the card itself)
257062,3548.tsv,2009-03-27T10:18:00.000Z,TheDeepFriedBoot,QPrime,Its a powered ext drive so that should not be an issue
257063,3548.tsv,2009-03-27T10:19:00.000Z,QPrime,TheDeepFriedBoot,"i gotacha on that, but you'd be surprised how often you need to power a PCMCIA card itself, even for attached usb devices that are self powered."
257064,3548.tsv,2009-03-27T10:20:00.000Z,TheDeepFriedBoot,QPrime,"Well that would still not be too much of an issue, this laptop is just coat hangered to the top of my other 2 screens and I use it to power my other USB junk so using a port to power the card is not an issue"
257065,3548.tsv,2009-03-27T10:24:00.000Z,QPrime,TheDeepFriedBoot,I found the birthing pains for Hardy more painful than Intrepid or Jaunty (so far) has been
257066,3548.tsv,2009-03-27T10:28:00.000Z,QPrime,TheDeepFriedBoot,you don't really what Gnome sucking away cache memory do you?  :P
257067,3548.tsv,2009-03-27T10:29:00.000Z,TheDeepFriedBoot,QPrime,"Well, I kind of want to use this laptop for more than a NAS as well. As I said, I have it clipped to the top of my other screens with clips made from coat hangars and I use it like a 3rd screen with synergy"
257068,3548.tsv,2009-03-27T10:30:00.000Z,TheDeepFriedBoot,QPrime,"Aww, but I dont want a terminal, it looks no nice on top of my other monitors, its like a HUD, currently its acting as a Wootoff monitor for me"
257069,3548.tsv,2009-03-27T10:32:00.000Z,TheDeepFriedBoot,QPrime,"OK, ill look into that when I have time to mess around with the laptop. As for FreeNAS, go take a look at it, its really neat"
257070,3548.tsv,2009-03-27T10:35:00.000Z,QPrime,TheDeepFriedBoot,"I'll check it out, thanks."
257071,3548.tsv,2009-03-27T10:39:00.000Z,TheDeepFriedBoot,QPrime,"I googled installing Xfce in FreeNAS and its been done, but it seems to be more work than its worth"

257073,3548.tsv,2009-03-27T10:42:00.000Z,TheDeepFriedBoot,QPrime,"I really dont have too much time to mess around with it. Too much work in college. Also, I like Ubuntu. Samba seems to work fine so ill stick with that I guess"

264195,11593.tsv,2005-04-12T11:22:00.000Z,saik0,,"hmm, does anybody know why DVD video would be choppy?"
264196,11593.tsv,2005-04-12T11:22:00.000Z,g14,saik0,linux isn't real time enough for video
264197,11593.tsv,2005-04-12T11:23:00.000Z,g14,saik0,thats why there are patches for the kernel for true audio / video distros like agnula
264198,11593.tsv,2005-04-12T11:23:00.000Z,saik0,g14,nonsense.....I had a mythTV box working perfectly with fedora as a distro...
264199,11593.tsv,2005-04-12T11:23:00.000Z,saik0,g14,at least I hope it's nonsense
264200,11593.tsv,2005-04-12T11:24:00.000Z,g14,saik0,nonsense? I am talking about professional av stuff
264201,11593.tsv,2005-04-12T11:25:00.000Z,g14,saik0,you might want a bit more before you call something nonsence you dont know about
264202,11593.tsv,2005-04-12T11:25:00.000Z,g14,,*read a bit more*
264203,11593.tsv,2005-04-12T11:26:00.000Z,g14,,"I set up a professional recording studio using ardour, rosegarden, and jack on agnula"
264204,11593.tsv,2005-04-12T11:26:00.000Z,saik0,g14,hey all I was trying to say was that I have sucessfully played DVDs without any skipping on other distros. I never meant to offended you and apologize if I did
264205,11593.tsv,2005-04-12T11:28:00.000Z,g14,saik0,thats fine. Linux having timing and sync issues with audio / video is a known issue. Fedora also uses a highly modified kernel
264206,11593.tsv,2005-04-12T11:29:00.000Z,g14,,type /join #cedega in the chat window
264207,11593.tsv,2005-04-12T11:31:00.000Z,g14,,seriously?
264208,11593.tsv,2005-04-12T11:31:00.000Z,g14,,for what
264209,11593.tsv,2005-04-12T11:34:00.000Z,saik0,g14,I figured out the problem DMA was diabled on my DVD drive
264210,11593.tsv,2005-04-12T11:35:00.000Z,g14,saik0,that would definatly do it :)
264211,11593.tsv,2005-04-12T11:36:00.000Z,saik0,g14,"sure would! not sure why ubuntu would come installed like that, I'm sure they have some reason. now to figure out a way to do this globally"
264212,11593.tsv,2005-04-12T11:37:00.000Z,g14,saik0,hdparm has a save option
264213,11593.tsv,2005-04-12T11:38:00.000Z,saik0,g14,found /etc/hdpram.conf also works
264214,11593.tsv,2005-04-12T11:38:00.000Z,g14,saik0,man hdparm will show you that the -k option will allow you to keep settings over reboot. Yep

275636,1446.tsv,2010-10-28T20:30:00.000Z,coz_,kpoorman,  I believe  xbindkeys
275637,1446.tsv,2010-10-28T20:30:00.000Z,kpoorman,coz_,so there's no system wide way to do it?

275639,1446.tsv,2010-10-28T20:31:00.000Z,coz_,kpoorman,  then Layouts tab  and then click  'Options' button on the bottom
275640,1446.tsv,2010-10-28T20:31:00.000Z,kpoorman,coz_,thats what I'm using (gnome) but I can't find the setting
275641,1446.tsv,2010-10-28T20:31:00.000Z,coz_,kpoorman, look under  preferences/keyboard...layouts tab   Options button
275642,1446.tsv,2010-10-28T20:33:00.000Z,kpoorman,coz_,do I need to  log out / log in ?
275643,1446.tsv,2010-10-28T20:33:00.000Z,coz_,kpoorman,  no it should take effect immediately
275644,1446.tsv,2010-10-28T20:33:00.000Z,coz_,kpoorman,  but  if it doesnt  try the log out
275645,1446.tsv,2010-10-28T20:38:00.000Z,kpoorman,coz_,I've selected the option 'control is mapped to win keys (and the usual ctrl keys)' but cmd-t does not create a new tab in firefox

275647,1446.tsv,2010-10-28T20:39:00.000Z,kpoorman,coz_,"well, as an example of the ctrl key being mapped to command"
275648,1446.tsv,2010-10-28T20:40:00.000Z,coz_,kpoorman, mm let me check 'Keyboard' under preferences
275649,1446.tsv,2010-10-28T20:42:00.000Z,coz_,kpoorman,  mm then I am not sure why that doesnt work
275650,1446.tsv,2010-10-28T20:45:00.000Z,kpoorman,coz_,does it work for you ?
275651,1446.tsv,2010-10-28T20:46:00.000Z,kpoorman,coz_,i'm using one of the aluminum keyboards

275654,1446.tsv,2010-10-28T20:47:00.000Z,coz_,kpoorman,  I also use easystroke  for things like this    the command can be assigned to a stroke

739387,15502.tsv,2010-11-19T00:32:00.000Z,joevandyk,ftg2,that assumes that the command is named the same as the package?
739388,15502.tsv,2010-11-19T00:33:00.000Z,ftg2,joevandyk,dunno. i googled it (to find out how to disable it). thats the package name. i just confirmed its on my system w/ that command
739389,15502.tsv,2010-11-19T00:33:00.000Z,ftg2,joevandyk,you can dpkg -l command-not-found ... to see what it contains

739394,15502.tsv,2010-11-19T00:35:00.000Z,joevandyk,ftg2,look at the link.  that's the behavior I want.

2764701,355.tsv,2008-11-02T04:13:00.000Z,tovella,Logikos,"if you have Sun's java installed, you might try using OpenJDK, instead."
2764702,355.tsv,2008-11-02T04:14:00.000Z,tovella,Logikos,"...try installing OpenJDK first, then try removing Sun's java."
2764703,355.tsv,2008-11-02T04:14:00.000Z,tovella,Logikos,some packages don't care which java is installed.
2764704,355.tsv,2008-11-02T04:15:00.000Z,Logikos,tovella,"k, i'll try, thanks"

2764706,355.tsv,2008-11-02T04:26:00.000Z,tovella,Logikos,let me see what i've got....
2764707,355.tsv,2008-11-02T04:26:00.000Z,Logikos,tovella,tyvm for looking into it
2764708,355.tsv,2008-11-02T04:27:00.000Z,tovella,Logikos,gcjwebplugin is a little web browser plugin to execute Java applets. i think it used OpenJDK.
2764709,355.tsv,2008-11-02T04:28:00.000Z,tovella,Logikos,"uses openjdk, i mean."
2764710,355.tsv,2008-11-02T04:28:00.000Z,Logikos,tovella,"ok... so what does that mean, i need to figureout how to instal ﻿gcjwebplugin ?"
2764711,355.tsv,2008-11-02T04:29:00.000Z,Logikos,tovella,when i search for it in add/remove i get icedtea java plugin
2764712,355.tsv,2008-11-02T04:29:00.000Z,tovella,Logikos,"from a terminal window you could type the command, 'sudo apt-get install gcjwebplugin'.  alternatively you could use the Synaptic Package Manager to install it."
2764713,355.tsv,2008-11-02T04:30:00.000Z,Logikos,tovella,"thanks, where is the 'synaptic package manager' when i try to uninstal sun java it says some junk about useing that?"
2764714,355.tsv,2008-11-02T04:31:00.000Z,Logikos,tovella,"nevermind, found the synaptic package manager"
2764715,355.tsv,2008-11-02T04:31:00.000Z,tovella,Logikos,on the gnome panel (the top bar) click on Sys... OK.
2764716,355.tsv,2008-11-02T04:31:00.000Z,Logikos,tovella,i instaled icedtea-﻿gcjwebplugin or something like that in just add/remove .... did that do basicly the same thing?
2764717,355.tsv,2008-11-02T04:31:00.000Z,tovella,Logikos,which version of ubuntu?
2764718,355.tsv,2008-11-02T04:32:00.000Z,Logikos,tovella,8.04
2764719,355.tsv,2008-11-02T04:32:00.000Z,Logikos,tovella,LTS
2764720,355.tsv,2008-11-02T04:32:00.000Z,tovella,Logikos,"then yes, use that one."
2764721,355.tsv,2008-11-02T04:32:00.000Z,Logikos,tovella,"k, thanks! i'll give it a try"
2764722,355.tsv,2008-11-02T04:33:00.000Z,tovella,Logikos,"on 8.10, it's listed as a 'transitional' package, ...going to be replaced by gcjwebplugin, i think."
2764723,355.tsv,2008-11-02T04:38:00.000Z,tovella,Logikos,"my apologies... after trying the website you posted, i see that it does in fact require Sun's java."
2764724,355.tsv,2008-11-02T04:38:00.000Z,tovella,Logikos,i'll really be glad when Sun is able to release a 64-bit version.
2764725,355.tsv,2008-11-02T04:39:00.000Z,Logikos,tovella,"i dont have a 64bit os right now so no big deal, but still ... its not working..."
2764726,355.tsv,2008-11-02T04:40:00.000Z,tovella,Logikos,i guess i should have asked before... how did you come to the point of installing via RPM?  why not the .deb that's in the repositories?
2764727,355.tsv,2008-11-02T04:41:00.000Z,Logikos,tovella,"i clicked a link online to get java, java only offered a few options for instal, rpm was one of them, i recignized it, so i read the instructions and tryed to do it, it didnt work though because of a bunch of dependancies ... so i didnt end up installing it by rpm ... i just tryed to"
2764728,355.tsv,2008-11-02T04:42:00.000Z,Logikos,tovella,i didnt see a .deb option
2764729,355.tsv,2008-11-02T04:42:00.000Z,Logikos,tovella,"now i'm in synaptic package manager looking for sun-java-6 to uninstall it, then i'll try again?"
2764730,355.tsv,2008-11-02T04:43:00.000Z,tovella,Logikos,"i see.  in situations like those, it's usually best to see if there's a version of the plugin available in the repositories.  add/remove won't show you nearly as many of the packages as Synaptic Package Manager does."
2764731,355.tsv,2008-11-02T04:44:00.000Z,Logikos,tovella,"yes, i'm learning :)"
2764732,355.tsv,2008-11-02T04:45:00.000Z,Logikos,tovella,ok i used synaptic package manager to completly remove sun-java-6 ... now what method do you recomend i use to add it back again? synaptic package manager also?
2764733,355.tsv,2008-11-02T04:46:00.000Z,tovella,Logikos,yes.
2764734,355.tsv,2008-11-02T04:49:00.000Z,Logikos,tovella,"i marked sun-java6-bin, sun-java6-plugin, sun-java6-jre marked itself, i also see sun-java6-jdk ... should i mark jdk also? or any others? such as doc, fonts, javadb,"
2764735,355.tsv,2008-11-02T04:50:00.000Z,tovella,Logikos,"not for what you're doing, just check sun-java6-jre... any others it requires will be marked automatically."
2764736,355.tsv,2008-11-02T04:50:00.000Z,Logikos,tovella,thanks
2764737,355.tsv,2008-11-02T04:51:00.000Z,tovella,Logikos,"actually, jre or plugin, should work just fine."
2764738,355.tsv,2008-11-02T04:51:00.000Z,Logikos,tovella,i checked them both... jre and plugin ?
2764739,355.tsv,2008-11-02T04:51:00.000Z,tovella,Logikos,you should be fine with that.
2764740,355.tsv,2008-11-02T06:00:00.000Z,Logikos,tovella,"on this page: http://java.com/en/download/help/testvm.xml .. the java test seems to work, however this page still says it requires a plugin: http://www.miniclip.com/games/robot-rage/en/ - i do have flash installed ..."
2764741,355.tsv,2008-11-02T06:02:00.000Z,tovella,Logikos,i don't know what more i can do with that problem.
2764742,355.tsv,2008-11-02T06:03:00.000Z,tovella,Logikos,i'm just about out of ideas.
2764743,355.tsv,2008-11-02T06:04:00.000Z,Logikos,tovella,"well at least the problem is different, the past problem was a failed instalation of java, java is now installed correctly near as i can tell ... that java test page works, but this game, and some others dont work?"
2764744,355.tsv,2008-11-02T06:05:00.000Z,tovella,Logikos,it could be that the site checks for a (dare i say it) microsoft browser.
2764745,355.tsv,2008-11-02T06:05:00.000Z,tovella,Logikos,... & plugins.
2764746,355.tsv,2008-11-02T06:06:00.000Z,Logikos,tovella,"its miniclip ... some of the other miniclip games work fine, even before i installed java, because they only required flash"
2764747,355.tsv,2008-11-02T06:08:00.000Z,tovella,Logikos,but now it looks like some of them require a specific vendor's java (Sun).  i don't have any experience with miniclip.
2764748,355.tsv,2008-11-02T06:09:00.000Z,Logikos,tovella,well isnt that what i installed? sun-java6-bin ...
2764749,355.tsv,2008-11-02T06:10:00.000Z,tovella,Logikos,"yes, the one compiled for Ubuntu, but some websites may be able to check to see which Sun java you have installed (as well as which web browser)."
2764750,355.tsv,2008-11-02T06:11:00.000Z,Logikos,tovella,"that seems doubtful, so when you go to the website it says your missing a plugin also? - there are some plugins i dont have .. adobe shockwave and igloader ... which i cant find linux versions of?"
2764751,355.tsv,2008-11-02T06:13:00.000Z,tovella,Logikos,i just don't have any real knowledge of how that particular website is setup.
2764752,355.tsv,2008-11-02T06:13:00.000Z,Logikos,tovella," its not just that website, if you google specific games, such as robot rage, it wont work on the other websites either ... but if the game wont load for you either... then i guess there just isnt a way...  thanks so much for trying"
2764753,355.tsv,2008-11-02T06:14:00.000Z,tovella,Logikos,"i wish i could help more, but i just don't play online games."

2868668,12077.tsv,2006-09-27T07:09:00.000Z,gnomefreak,omar,it could be the page isnt working (you havent given me a page that gives you problems

4247798,355.tsv,2009-11-18T03:31:00.000Z,faryshta_,jongbergs,already did. MD5 is the same.
4247799,355.tsv,2009-11-18T03:32:00.000Z,faryshta_,jongbergs,what is weird is I have Intrepid in that same computer.
4247800,355.tsv,2009-11-18T03:32:00.000Z,jongbergs,faryshta_,and did you encounter the same problem with intrepid?
4247801,355.tsv,2009-11-18T03:33:00.000Z,faryshta_,jongbergs,not at all.
4247802,355.tsv,2009-11-18T03:34:00.000Z,jongbergs,faryshta_,"btw, what hardware platform you currently have?"
4247803,355.tsv,2009-11-18T03:36:00.000Z,jongbergs,faryshta_,is could be an issue related to karmic's failing to boot under 64-bit
4247804,355.tsv,2009-11-18T03:36:00.000Z,jongbergs,faryshta_,have you done googling with this issue?
4247805,355.tsv,2009-11-18T03:37:00.000Z,faryshta_,jongbergs,I am right now.
4247806,355.tsv,2009-11-18T03:38:00.000Z,jongbergs,faryshta_,and your using and AMD 64 cpu?
4247807,355.tsv,2009-11-18T03:40:00.000Z,faryshta_,jongbergs,yes is a amd Athlon x2
4247808,355.tsv,2009-11-18T03:45:00.000Z,faryshta_,jongbergs,seems is an open bug (probably will never be solved in Karmic).
4247809,355.tsv,2009-11-18T03:47:00.000Z,jongbergs,faryshta_,"probably, this bug has already been submitted to launchpad..we just hope ubuntu team will issue a fix asap."
4247810,355.tsv,2009-11-18T03:49:00.000Z,faryshta_,jongbergs,but for use the solution I will need to have ubuntu installed the only way to actually fix it is by releasing another .iso which I see improbable.
4247811,355.tsv,2009-11-18T03:52:00.000Z,jongbergs,faryshta_,does the version of ubuntu is 64-bit?
4247812,355.tsv,2009-11-18T03:52:00.000Z,faryshta_,jongbergs,yes.
4247813,355.tsv,2009-11-18T03:55:00.000Z,jongbergs,faryshta_,"ok let's try again by selecting all the F6 options except free software only, as well as safe graphics mode under F4"
4247814,355.tsv,2009-11-18T04:02:00.000Z,faryshta_,jongbergs,"sorry, done and failed."
4247815,355.tsv,2009-11-18T04:04:00.000Z,jongbergs,faryshta_,"i felt sorry for it, we need some time to get it fixed : )"
4247816,355.tsv,2009-11-18T04:06:00.000Z,faryshta_,jongbergs,don't worry. At least I will try it in my laptop.
4247817,355.tsv,2009-11-18T04:07:00.000Z,faryshta_,jongbergs,if I use the synaptic update to get karmic... you think will have the same issue?
4247818,355.tsv,2009-11-18T04:09:00.000Z,jongbergs,faryshta_,"you can do so, however an alternate install cd  does the same thing and saves you extra time, still i don't know if it works out."
4247819,355.tsv,2009-11-18T04:12:00.000Z,faryshta_,jongbergs,the bug is in the kernel as far as Launchpad says. So will be the same and I will have to avoid Karmic in the job.

4328559,28263.tsv,2007-10-13T08:13:00.000Z,predaeus,steve1,"I don't know, maybe you used some sudo rights when installing/copying, now it would use the same rights to change config files. So it just changes nothing. But I don't know."
4328560,28263.tsv,2007-10-13T08:15:00.000Z,steve1,predaeus,"well i installed the game and the owner was set to root, so i changed it so steven (me) and still didn't work"
4328561,28263.tsv,2007-10-13T08:16:00.000Z,predaeus,steve1,probably you should just install it locally as yourself
4328562,28263.tsv,2007-10-13T08:16:00.000Z,steve1,predaeus,yes i have installed it to /home

4328565,28263.tsv,2007-10-13T08:20:00.000Z,predaeus,steve1,you might need to allow the installer to copy the game's binary to /usr/bin or something so you can run it from everywhere. But never run the game as root.
4328566,28263.tsv,2007-10-13T08:21:00.000Z,steve1,predaeus,ok so maybe a reinstall is in order
4328567,28263.tsv,2007-10-13T08:22:00.000Z,predaeus,steve1,read the README or INSTALL files that accompany the game for details. I am sure they explain everything there.

4916008,11267.tsv,2011-06-17T06:44:00.000Z,toad`,,do I specify partitions manually and delete the partition that has Ubuntu on it already?

5054001,355.tsv,2011-04-02T13:43:00.000Z,Axlin,truepurple_,i'm afraid i don't know of anybody personally. your best bet would be to ask why update manager is rejecting your password

5208200,355.tsv,2011-11-16T00:49:00.000Z,coder2,,"Hello. I have MP3 player. It is detected everywehere, except one computer. I have investigated that the player there is being detected as USB1.1 device. Please help."
5208201,355.tsv,2011-11-16T00:50:00.000Z,Gareth_Lock,coder2,How old is the machine... Both the device and the mobo both have to support USB 2.0 etc for it to work.
5208202,355.tsv,2011-11-16T00:51:00.000Z,Gareth_Lock,coder2,It might just be that the PC in question is too old to understand anything other that USB 1.1
5208203,355.tsv,2011-11-16T00:52:00.000Z,coder2,Gareth_Lock,The mobo is GigaByte N650SLI-DS4 - NVidia 650i chipset. OS is lucid.
5208204,355.tsv,2011-11-16T00:53:00.000Z,coder2,Gareth_Lock,The computer is working well with USB 2.0 flash
5208205,355.tsv,2011-11-16T00:55:00.000Z,Gareth_Lock,coder2,OK... So the board is USB 2 capable.
5208206,355.tsv,2011-11-16T00:56:00.000Z,coder2,Gareth_Lock,sure
5208207,355.tsv,2011-11-16T00:56:00.000Z,Gareth_Lock,coder2,Does the MP3 player detect as USB 2 in the other machines?
5208208,355.tsv,2011-11-16T00:57:00.000Z,coder2,Gareth_Lock,"Yes, It works well on my second computer. The same OS, but other mobo."
5208209,355.tsv,2011-11-16T00:58:00.000Z,Gareth_Lock,coder2,"I have a sneaking suspicion this might be a hardware issue, though exactly what, I'm not sure."
5208210,355.tsv,2011-11-16T00:59:00.000Z,Gareth_Lock,coder2,What you could try doing is install another OS on this mobo and see if it detects it as USB 2. See whether it's down to the OS or the hardware.
5208211,355.tsv,2011-11-16T01:00:00.000Z,coder2,Gareth_Lock,thanks.
5208212,355.tsv,2011-11-16T01:01:00.000Z,coder2,Gareth_Lock,One note: the player was detected there only once.
5208213,355.tsv,2011-11-16T01:01:00.000Z,Gareth_Lock,coder2,Only once on which mobo... The Gigabyte in question or another?
5208214,355.tsv,2011-11-16T01:03:00.000Z,coder2,Gareth_Lock,"I have seen the player detected once on that gigabyte computer. And other USB2 devices: camera, flash, cellphone works well"
5208215,355.tsv,2011-11-16T01:04:00.000Z,Gareth_Lock,coder2,Strange... Way strange. What changed since the MP3 player was detected sucessfully.
5208216,355.tsv,2011-11-16T01:05:00.000Z,coder2,Gareth_Lock,nothing has changed.
5208217,355.tsv,2011-11-16T01:05:00.000Z,Gareth_Lock,coder2,I'm having suspicions it may be a clash somewhere...
5208218,355.tsv,2011-11-16T01:08:00.000Z,Gareth_Lock,coder2,Maybe it's drawing too much power or something... A possibility.
5208219,355.tsv,2011-11-16T01:09:00.000Z,Gareth_Lock,coder2,"Try fully charging it first, then connecting it up, if it detects it then, power is a possibility. Either that or connect it through a powered USB 2 hub."
5208220,355.tsv,2011-11-16T01:10:00.000Z,Gareth_Lock,coder2,"Either way, try and reduce the load on the USB."
5208221,355.tsv,2011-11-16T01:10:00.000Z,coder2,Gareth_Lock,"I do not have powered USB hub. But I like your idea about charging, thanks"
5208222,355.tsv,2011-11-16T01:11:00.000Z,Gareth_Lock,coder2,No probs...

5367442,26868.tsv,2011-10-25T20:20:00.000Z,dr_willis,lesshaste, i tend to use k9copy
5367443,26868.tsv,2011-10-25T20:20:00.000Z,lesshaste,dr_willis,thanks.. I am checking it out
5367444,26868.tsv,2011-10-25T20:20:00.000Z,dr_willis,lesshaste, often i use k9copy to backup to an iso file.. then i rencode/rip from that iso file.. faster that way  for me.
5367445,26868.tsv,2011-10-25T20:21:00.000Z,lesshaste,dr_willis,can you just rip individual episodes?
5367446,26868.tsv,2011-10-25T20:21:00.000Z,dr_willis,lesshaste, theres arista also . but not tried it much.

5367450,26868.tsv,2011-10-25T20:22:00.000Z,dr_willis,lesshaste, one issue is that the default ffmpeg and mencoder I think do not have all the differnt file type support compiled in.
5367451,26868.tsv,2011-10-25T20:22:00.000Z,lesshaste,dr_willis,ah.. ok that sounds serious

7148345,45478.tsv,2008-08-10T03:41:00.000Z,stroyan,h_,amd64 hardware can run 32 bit operating systems.  And most 64-bit operating systems can run 32-bit software.  But you left out all the details about what kind of software you want to run.  So people are making many assumptions about those details.

8127910,1446.tsv,2007-12-10T02:07:00.000Z,KDuB,,Can someone give me the command to unmound my ntfs drive?
8127911,1446.tsv,2007-12-10T02:07:00.000Z,KDuB,,Can someone give me the command to unmount my ntfs drive?
8127912,1446.tsv,2007-12-10T02:09:00.000Z,Slart,KDuB,sudo umount /mountpoint should work
8127913,1446.tsv,2007-12-10T02:12:00.000Z,KDuB,Slart,i was trying to unmount it so i could rename it however that wasnt the case because i still cant rename it even though it was not mounted.
8127914,1446.tsv,2007-12-10T02:13:00.000Z,Slart,KDuB,rename 'it'? what is the 'it' ? the mountpoint? or you want to rename the drive?
8127915,1446.tsv,2007-12-10T02:14:00.000Z,Slart,KDuB,hmm.. you are sure you want to rename the drive?? don't think you can do that
8127916,1446.tsv,2007-12-10T02:14:00.000Z,Slart,KDuB,I think you really want to rename the mountpoint...
8127917,1446.tsv,2007-12-10T02:15:00.000Z,Slart,KDuB,the mount-point is what you use the use the drive.. the mount point is what shows up in nautilus
8127918,1446.tsv,2007-12-10T02:16:00.000Z,Slart,KDuB,and the mountpoint is just a folder.. just like every other folder.. change the name of the folder.. and change the mountpoint accordingly in /etc/fstab or when you mount it
8127919,1446.tsv,2007-12-10T02:16:00.000Z,KDuB,Slart,how can i mount it back?
8127920,1446.tsv,2007-12-10T02:17:00.000Z,Slart,KDuB,you didn't mount it manually I guess.. then open the file /etc/fstab... (gksu gedit /etc/fstab) and find the line for your drive.. change the mountpoint to whatever you want then just run 'mount -a' or perhaps 'sudo mount -a'
8127921,1446.tsv,2007-12-10T02:19:00.000Z,Slart,KDuB,now rename the folder too and you should be set.. no you don't have to reboot
8127922,1446.tsv,2007-12-10T02:19:00.000Z,KDuB,Slart,where do i go to access the boot menu?
8127923,1446.tsv,2007-12-10T02:20:00.000Z,Slart,KDuB,just run that command.. 'mount -a' or 'sudo mount -a'

8200907,355.tsv,2010-05-15T18:19:00.000Z,vivien`,lyrae,"In my .bashrc, I have 'eval `dircolors ~/.ls_colors`', with .ls_colors pasted here: http://pastebin.com/QKDVnx7F"
8200908,355.tsv,2010-05-15T18:20:00.000Z,lyrae,vivien`,is that your bashrc?
8200909,355.tsv,2010-05-15T18:20:00.000Z,vivien`,lyrae,"No, just ~/.ls_colors, which is evaled with 'eval `dircolors ~/.ls_colors`' in .bashrc (remove the quotes and put it in .bashrc)"

8200914,355.tsv,2010-05-15T18:25:00.000Z,vivien`,lyrae,"Yes, but it is eval `dircolors ~/.ls_colors` with ticks `, not quotes."

8200916,355.tsv,2010-05-15T18:26:00.000Z,lyrae,vivien`,yep. not working
8200917,355.tsv,2010-05-15T18:27:00.000Z,vivien`,lyrae,"and maybe the scheme in .ls_colors is the same as your current scheme, so that you do not see a difference! Try to modify the colors. And launch 'ls --color=auto' instead of ls."
8200918,355.tsv,2010-05-15T18:28:00.000Z,vivien`,lyrae,"Dr_Willis is right, eval $(dircolors ~/.ls_colors) is easier to read. But it does the same as with the ticks."
8200919,355.tsv,2010-05-15T18:28:00.000Z,lyrae,vivien`,are any of your colors purple/pink?
8200920,355.tsv,2010-05-15T18:30:00.000Z,vivien`,lyrae,"No purple or pink, I think"
8200921,355.tsv,2010-05-15T18:30:00.000Z,lyrae,vivien`,then nvm. i thought it changed but didn't
8200922,355.tsv,2010-05-15T18:31:00.000Z,vivien`,lyrae,"Try with 'ls --color=always', just in case"
8200923,355.tsv,2010-05-15T18:33:00.000Z,lyrae,vivien`,dont know. i think it changed from blueish to purple. but this one hard disk shows green with blue
8200924,355.tsv,2010-05-15T18:34:00.000Z,lyrae,vivien`,"yes. i commented out the eval line. its back to blue when ls a regular dir. but when i ls a disk that was mounted as root, its green and blue"
8200925,355.tsv,2010-05-15T18:35:00.000Z,vivien`,lyrae,what is the output of 'eval `dircolors ~/.ls_colors`'?
8200926,355.tsv,2010-05-15T18:36:00.000Z,lyrae,vivien`,nothing
8200927,355.tsv,2010-05-15T18:37:00.000Z,vivien`,lyrae,What do you mean by 'nothing'? It must at least return 'export LS_COLORS'!
8200928,355.tsv,2010-05-15T18:37:00.000Z,lyrae,vivien`,nope
8200929,355.tsv,2010-05-15T18:37:00.000Z,vivien`,lyrae,"Oups, I meant 'dircolors ~/.ls_colors' alone."
8200930,355.tsv,2010-05-15T18:38:00.000Z,lyrae,vivien`,outputs 'LS_COLORS='no=00:fi=00:di=01;35:ln=01;36:pi=40;' and so on
8200931,355.tsv,2010-05-15T18:38:00.000Z,vivien`,lyrae,So it is working. You can change the colors in .ls_colors now.
8200932,355.tsv,2010-05-15T18:39:00.000Z,lyrae,vivien`,it seems to be working. but if the folder was mounted by root. then its green on blue
8200933,355.tsv,2010-05-15T18:39:00.000Z,lyrae,vivien`,but its green on blue with or without ls_colors. so i believe ls_colors doesnt change colors of dirs/files of root mounted dirs
8200934,355.tsv,2010-05-15T18:40:00.000Z,vivien`,lyrae,"I am pretty sure it does, but you need to find the entry in ls_colors"
8200935,355.tsv,2010-05-15T18:41:00.000Z,lyrae,vivien`,ok. ill take it from here :) thank you
8200936,355.tsv,2010-05-15T18:41:00.000Z,vivien`,lyrae,"you are welcome. I do not know which entry, but you should find. At least you have a way to edit the colors!"
8200937,355.tsv,2010-05-15T18:42:00.000Z,lyrae,vivien`,eventually ill get it
8200938,355.tsv,2010-05-15T18:43:00.000Z,vivien`,lyrae,"It must be in the lines after NORMAL, etc. Note that other entries are accepted, like SETUID and SETGID."

8555194,6273.tsv,2010-01-02T15:35:00.000Z,_raven_,iceroot,because sometimes it crashes and falls back into the default mode (grey-white instead of 3d for example)
8555195,6273.tsv,2010-01-02T15:36:00.000Z,iceroot,_raven_,maybe its better to fix that instead of other things
8555196,6273.tsv,2010-01-02T15:37:00.000Z,_raven_,iceroot,its not often but when it happens would be nice to keep the applications open - so its not possible?

9190286,42687.tsv,2005-04-12T08:56:00.000Z,DanC_ub,,ugh... using timidity with esddsp sounds horrible
9190287,42687.tsv,2005-04-12T08:57:00.000Z,DanC_ub,,argh! I thought we just established that esd/polypaudio was the way to go. Why is it best to use alsa directly?
9190288,42687.tsv,2005-04-12T08:58:00.000Z,DanC_ub,,"yeah, I can hear the difference in quality, geppy. I'd like to understand *why*"
9190289,42687.tsv,2005-04-12T08:59:00.000Z,DanC_ub,,esd has alsa support? I don't see it in th man page...
9190290,42687.tsv,2005-04-12T08:59:00.000Z,HrdwrBoB,DanC_ub,esd uses the OSS emulation for alsa support
9190291,42687.tsv,2005-04-12T09:03:00.000Z,HrdwrBoB,DanC_ub,it all uses gstreamer
9190292,42687.tsv,2005-04-12T09:03:00.000Z,HrdwrBoB,DanC_ub,you can change the default gstreamer sink

9193280,11593.tsv,2009-04-20T08:27:00.000Z,unop,psywiped,given that subnet mask - that address cannot be a gateway
9193281,11593.tsv,2009-04-20T08:28:00.000Z,unop,psywiped,"192.168.1.0 is not a valid host address because all host bits are 0, it is the network/subnet address"
9193282,11593.tsv,2009-04-20T08:30:00.000Z,unop,psywiped,there's a difference between a subnet and a subnet mask - they are two different things
