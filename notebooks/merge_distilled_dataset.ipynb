         "In Ubuntu, the appearance of icons on the desktop is controlled by the Desktop File (.desktop file) associated with the device. Unfortunately, there isn't a built-in way to hide specific device icons from the desktop.\n\nHowever, you can create a custom script that hides the specific external HDD when it's mounted, and then unmounts it when you want to see the icon again. Here's a basic example of how you might do this:\n\n1. Create a new folder for the script:\n\n```\nmkdir ~/scripts"
