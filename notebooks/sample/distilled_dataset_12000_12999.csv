"User: I have an external HD, if I reformat as ext4, will there be any issues auto-mounting the device?
Assistant:","If you reformat your external hard drive to ext4, it will be compatible with Linux systems that support ext4. However, if you want to use it on Windows, you may encounter issues as Windows does not natively support ext4. To resolve this, you can use third-party software like Ext2Fsd or ExtFS to make the drive readable on Windows.

For auto-mounting the device on Linux, you can create an entry in the fstab file. Here's a simple example:

```

Assistant:","It seems that the SUPER key (usually the Windows key) behaves differently in key combinations compared to other keys. This is due to its system-wide functionality.

In most cases, the SUPER key is used to open the Start menu or perform system-wide actions. When you try to use it in a key combination, it often takes precedence over the other key's intended function.

For example, pressing `Ctrl + Alt + Super + Arrow` might open the Start menu instead of moving the active window. To work around this, you can try using the SUPER key"

Assistant:","By default, the password for the su (or sudo) command is not set. When you first install a Linux system, the root user account is disabled, and you're expected to use sudo instead. The password for sudo is set during the installation process or can be set later using the `sudo passwd root` command. However, it's strongly recommended to use sudo rather than su for security reasons."

"User: but sudo (not su) uses your user's password
Assistant:","That's correct! The `sudo` command allows a permitted user to execute a command with the security privileges of another user (by default, the superuser). When you use `sudo`, it prompts for your user's password, not the root password. This is a more secure approach as it allows administrators to delegate certain tasks to other users without giving them full root access.

If you use the `su` command, it switches the current user to the superuser (root) and prompts for the root password. This means that anyone with access to the root account can perform administrative tasks"
