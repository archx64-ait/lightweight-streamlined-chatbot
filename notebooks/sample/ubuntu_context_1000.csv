275636,1446.tsv,2010-10-28T20:30:00.000Z,coz_,kpoorman,  I believe  xbindkeys
275637,1446.tsv,2010-10-28T20:30:00.000Z,kpoorman,coz_,so there's no system wide way to do it?
275638,1446.tsv,2010-10-28T20:30:00.000Z,coz_,kpoorman, well on gnome you can go to system/preferences/keyboard
275639,1446.tsv,2010-10-28T20:31:00.000Z,coz_,kpoorman,  then Layouts tab  and then click  'Options' button on the bottom
275640,1446.tsv,2010-10-28T20:31:00.000Z,kpoorman,coz_,thats what I'm using (gnome) but I can't find the setting
275641,1446.tsv,2010-10-28T20:31:00.000Z,coz_,kpoorman, look under  preferences/keyboard...layouts tab   Options button
275642,1446.tsv,2010-10-28T20:33:00.000Z,kpoorman,coz_,do I need to  log out / log in ?
275643,1446.tsv,2010-10-28T20:33:00.000Z,coz_,kpoorman,  no it should take effect immediately
275644,1446.tsv,2010-10-28T20:33:00.000Z,coz_,kpoorman,  but  if it doesnt  try the log out
275645,1446.tsv,2010-10-28T20:38:00.000Z,kpoorman,coz_,I've selected the option 'control is mapped to win keys (and the usual ctrl keys)' but cmd-t does not create a new tab in firefox

275647,1446.tsv,2010-10-28T20:39:00.000Z,kpoorman,coz_,"well, as an example of the ctrl key being mapped to command"
275648,1446.tsv,2010-10-28T20:40:00.000Z,coz_,kpoorman, mm let me check 'Keyboard' under preferences
275649,1446.tsv,2010-10-28T20:42:00.000Z,coz_,kpoorman,  mm then I am not sure why that doesnt work

375067,1446.tsv,2009-04-10T16:55:00.000Z,jrib,shlunk,"So in  a terminal you are able to edit and view the files, correct?  Try hitting reload in dolphin (in gnome at least, you have to hit reload when you change permissions)."

375082,1446.tsv,2009-04-10T17:05:00.000Z,shlunk,jrib,thanks anyway
375083,1446.tsv,2009-04-10T17:06:00.000Z,jrib,shlunk,only thing I would try is to log out and back in
